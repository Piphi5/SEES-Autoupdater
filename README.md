# SEES-Autoupdater
Uses Github Actions to automatically run a script that pulls mosquito mapper data and landcover data collected by NASA SEES Interns from the GLOBE API and generates CSV files.

This allows daily SEES only data to be collected for final research projects.

## Usage

Under the results folder, there are csv files with daily GLOBE data. Choose the file containing the desired date of data that you would like to use and click on it.

Then press the Download Button and that should redirect you to a tab on your browser. Now press (CTRL or CMD) + S to save that data onto your computer.
